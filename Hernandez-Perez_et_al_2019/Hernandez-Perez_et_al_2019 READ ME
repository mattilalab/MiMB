The Script should be run with FIJI (ImageJ) The accompaniying sample stacks should be saved in a "input" folder.

Running a script: 
1.select an input folder with sample stacks in 2 channels/select an output folder for results 
2.select Alternative (choice of different systems, since FIJI behaves differently in different systems), 
if it does not work the first time uncheck the second time... 
3.select deconvoluted (in case your images are not deconvoluted uncheck it 
4.select if results should be saved as .txt or .csv 
5.select which kind of automatic thresholding do you wish to be performed 
6.wait that the script loads your two stacks 
7.script creates a z-projection for easier selection of each cell,
choose how much brighter the projection should be in a range from 0-5 (bellow 0.5 gets darker, above brighter) 
8.choose how many selections will you make 
9.make individual selections and wait each time, that script asks you to do next selection... 
10. check the results in output folder
